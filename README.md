I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nilay Mukhopadhyay, as a Data Analyst/Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst, I specialize in creating interactive dashboards, automating reports, and optimizing project efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š My Top3 Projects
1. My Fitness Tracker

Tools Used: Power BI, Google Sheets, Microsoft Fabric, and SQL.
I started walking to get fit, but consistency was a problem. Then, a friend suggested using a Power BI dashboard with my walking data from Samsung Health. It made tracking my progress fun and helped me stay on track. This project was born out of my personal fitness goals. I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

2. Ski Pass Affordability in Europe and Asia

Tools Used: Power BI, ChatGPT, Excel, and PPT.
The objective was to help users find their perfect winter getaway considering factors like budget, location, and timing, presented through an Interactive Exploratory Dashboard. Notably, the budget-friendly ski pass prices in Europe and Asia caught my attention, prompting a more in-depth analysis.

3. Customer Segmentation Analysis

Tools Used: Power BI and SQL.
The primary objective of this study is to reveal meaningful patterns using the RFM methodology and to predict potential factors that may influence customer churn in the future.
